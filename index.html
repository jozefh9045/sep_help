            <h1>An Introduction to SEP!</h1>
            <p>Hello there! Welcome to a guide to what SEP is. On the top of this page, there are pages where I'll describe what's taught through the grades of SEP. Lower in this page, I'll describe what's needed to know about SEP in general.</p>

                <h1>30%</h1>
                <p>30% of the preogram's grade is being active in class. This includes answering the teacher's questions and helping other students.</p>

                <p>50% are quizzes and projects with their portfolios. These show that you know what you're doing in class.</p>

                    <p>The first part of anything is the planning stage. In SEP, you'll learn how to write in something called: pseudo code! Pseudo code is basically code that's simplified and for humans to understand. You can also plan code by just thinking
                        about it or writing it down in your spare time. It's also useful to plan when you'll work on code so you can meet deadlines. Should you work on it a bit at a time, or wait for the last minute? A lot of things can go wrong when
                        coding, so its useful to work on it a chunk at a time or try to finish as early as possible.</p>

                    <h1>Collaboration/Communication</h1>
                </div>
                <div class='col-sm-8 col-sm-pull-4 in-content'>
                    <p>In class and in the real world, teamwork is important. Sometimes, you'll need help or you'll need to work with someone, so it's useful to be social, inside or outside of class. There are a lot of fourms out there that involve coding
                        and people out in the internet can help you with pretty much anything (just remember to not give any personal information...).</p>

                </div>
                <div class='col-sm-8 text-content'>
                    <p>Sometimes, you won't be working with others who will know how to do something you want to do. In this situation, you'll have to Learn On Your Own (LOYO). Remember: Google is your friend. If you want to know how to do something, you
                        can search how to do it and maybe find an answer to your problem. W3schools can also help if you know what part of coding it is (HTML? CSS? Bootstrap?).</p>

        <div class='col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1'>
            <p>When in this class, you'll be able to attend a lot of events! SEP offers field trips, hackathons (where people get together to code something), year-end showcases (where SEP classes from different schools get together and present their projects),
                and other coding related events that are fun and informative!</p>
